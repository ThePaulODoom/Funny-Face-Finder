## What is it?

Funny Face Finder is a tool that crops the faces in a set of pictures.

**Note:** It does not crop every face, but it crops most of them.

## How do I use it?

First, you need Python 3.6.8 and have all of the required libraries by typing into your Terminal or CMD: ```pip install -r requirments.txt```. Then, put your pictures into the input directory. After that, run the Python file by typing the following in your CMD: ```python facefinder.py```

**Note:** If you are on Mac or Linux, type the following into the Terminal:  ```python3 facefinder.py```

You will find the images in the output directory.

## Why was this made?

I made this because I liked to harass people by cropping their face and sending it to them. This way, I did not have to do this manually.
